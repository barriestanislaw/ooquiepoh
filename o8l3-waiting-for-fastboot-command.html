                            <p>Стремительное распространение смартфонов, ставшей уже знаменитой компании meizu, продолжается и сегодня. So this is the guide I'm following right now: Yes, I have installed the drivers for pixel c, and yes, I have installed adb/fastboot as per the guide. However, upon trying to unlock the bootloader with "adb reload bootloader" I believe, my pixel c does in fact reboot, but it'll be stuck at "waiting for fastboot command", even when I go ahead and enter "fastboot oem unlock", then the command prompt will just be waiting for device the entire time. Hi, a while ago I put Lineage on to the Pixel. No problem there everything worked fine. About a week ago I noticed it started having trouble waking up i.e. the screen would stay black. It was clear that the device itself was working because you could here the sounds when clicking the power button. Sometimes it would just start no problems other times it would stay black andf then mysteriously light up again. I couldn't determine if it was a hardware or software fault. However, holding I tried to root, install twrp, install rooted. I'm in over my head. I managed to unbrick it (sort of) and now it's in the bootloader. It's waiting for fastboot commands but nothing I've tried works. I can't access the stock recovery. Oh my god this is my only phone. I'm retarded. When i start the tablet it only shows the logo and press esc to enter the bios, over and over again, i can enter the bios and open android but i can only do that, i tried to reinstall windows 10 and the usb have the same issue, can't boot it, i tried to install another android as well ( a mod with no chinese things) and i can't because when i try to enter fastboot it says "Entering DnX mode. Waiting for fastboot command.". Hi, I recently got my hands on a cheap, China-made OEM Windows tablet, branded and resold by a local company which has since seemingly gone out of business. It runs Windows 8.1 and is nothing special, I'd just like to play around with it (install Windows 10 or Ubuntu) now that I have it. Problem is, I don't know how to get into the BIOS/UEFI or boot from USB (it has a micro-USB port and an USB OTG adapter was included, which works fine with flash drives under Windows 8.1). I tried all kinds. Hi there, I accidental deleted some partitions in disk manager on the windows side of my chuwi hi8. However, when trying to boot back to android it comes up with entering DnX mode waiting for fastboot command. 
This is a cross post from /r/techsupport (https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/3cayex/deleted_partition_4_images_from_hipstreet_w7_now/) I'm reposting this here in hopes of getting help. I have no idea how to proceed and any help would be appreciated. I looked at the sidebar and didn't find any rules against posting for some help, so if it is a rule (posted elsewhere) I apologize and feel free to remove this! My cousin bought himself a Hipstreet W7 tablet (from what I understand. So my aunt/uncle often ask me to clean up their computers at their place because my little cousins always tend install everything under the moon. Usually I just remove malware and such and the PCs are back to normal but this time around one of them seems to have screwed up pretty well. My cousin bought himself a Hipstreet W7 tablet (from what I understand it's a Windows tablet) and he somehow screwed it up pretty badly. I have a note from him that says "Deleted Partition 4 (Images)". My last phone was the OnePlus 5T. Before that it was the Nexus 6. I've loved stock Android and have appreciated the speedy and clean experience. No bloat is the way to go. March isn't a good time of year for a phone to break, but my sim reader about had it. The S10+ was the newest device I could get that had the hardware I needed, so I decided to give it a shot. Here are some things I've done to make the switch easier for a stock Android fan-boy. Prerequisites: Minimal I've had one hell of a week with this phone but long story short; I want to put the factory image back on the razer phone 1. The problem I'm running into is using the flash all command. Every time I try it it will just say waiting for device even though it's already in download mode. I was able to put lineage on it by using the fastboot flash boot on both a and b and that worked. I tried doing that with the boot.img that came in the factory download from razer and it doesn't show the same proces. 
I'll preface this by saying I apologize for being technologically inept. I'm trying to upgrade From CyanogenMod to Lineage OS I followed the instructions here: https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/bacon/install but on Step 4 , after typing the command fastboot devices the output is blank. I proceeded to the next step fastboot oem unlock but then the output says waiting for device and that's where I'm stuck. Title. I had already gone and installed the Samsung ADB Drivers from this link here: https://developer.samsung.com/galaxy/others/android-usb-driver-for-windows. I then had done the usual process of enabling developer mode on an Android Device (go to about phone, tap on build number 7 times, agree to be developer). Afterwords I went ahead and enabled USB Debugging for the device and plugged it into my phone. I went ahead and opened CMD and used CD to navigate to the desktop on Windows 10 where. So Im trying to flash TWRP through fastboot (since I dont have root), but when I boot into fastboot with "adb reboot bootloader" command, I end up in fastboot. But when I then try to flash twrp through "fastboot flash recovery twrp.img" (I named the twrp file "twrp.img") it just says "waiting for any device". What is the issue. Hi, i tried to flash pm on oneplus-bacon, but when i try to flash rootfs i have this error: davidemaglio  ~  pmbootstrap flasher flash_rootfs 00:40:59 (native) flash rootfs image 00:41:00 (native) install android-tools < waiting for any device > target reported max download size of 1073741824 bytes Invalid sparse file format at header magic Erasing 'system'. OKAY 0.058s Sending sparse 'system' 1/1 (935649 KB). OKAY 29.786s. Hey guys, i don't know if this is right subreddit to post this but here goes. Fastboot mode only shows while adb recognize the device when runnings the command "adb devices" it list my device but when i run the command "fastboot devices" nothing hapoens it just return to c/adb in power shell. i have already booted my device in fastboot mode by adb command "adb reboot bootloader" i have usb debugging and OEM unlocking enabled in devloper mode and also installed If you're reading this you've probably realized its a major challenge to transfer your Neko Atsume game data from your old phone to your new phone. I had just successfully transferred and continued playing Neko Atsume on my new phone with all my cats and mementos intact (THANK GOODNESS!) using the ADB (Android Debug Bridge) method and commands that's listed on Recombu's guide here: https://recombu.com/mobile/article/neko-atsume-how-to-back-up-and-transfer-game-data Theres a few lessons I learn. Hi all I have a h910 model. I followed this guide https://forum.xda-developers.com/v20/how-to/root-h910-v10m-t3664500 and flashed the h915 kdz. Everything was going smoothly until I had to execute STEP3.BAT in the root package. Nothing happens, it just stays in fastboot while the command prompt says  Has anyone tried this method? What did you do to make it work? Thanks for any help. I really appreciate. 
I'm really anxious and nervous about this so I'll simplify this as much as I can; recently my phone was turned on on top of my desk and randomly restarted. I thought little of it, as it quickly went through the OnePlus logo (it began to take longer the second time I restarted it) and Android splash screen, but then stopped on the circles animation and remained looping there. I have very important data on it that I'd like to recover and WILL NOT factory reset (flash) my phone. I've been following this guide (https://www.wikihow.tech/Use-Link2SD) in order to root my Alcatel OneTouch PIXI Glory and be able to save apps on my microSD card. I used the Windows version of KingoRoot (with my phone connected to my laptop), which gave me access to the SuperUser app on my phone. However, SuperUser claims the phone still isn't technically rooted; this is corroborated by the Link2SD app (mentioned in Step 3 of the above guide) giving me an error after selecting the file system. Folks, I have two CHIP(s) - one due for a GUI flash and one due for a reflash of the PocketCHIP. With the online flasher offline, I've gone through almost every post I can find. I've successfully acquired the OVA VirtualBox Vagrant image, the CHIP tools and the images in general. In running the main flash command both CHIPs behave identically, they both detect the FEL mode but then they both timeout waiting for fastboot (during which time my windows PC host makes all the fun sounds As topic says; I had the phone for 3 days, and was playing around with it. But now that I've gotten the bootloader unlocked, I'm looking to get TWRP running so I can back up the stock rom or whatnot before proceeding further. Edit TWRP and Magisk solved. But still interested in hearing about what the best firmware to jump into is. Priority being Battery Life, Notifications appearing correctly, and GCam. /Edit --- TWRP: ~~So I see the official download 
Every single day someone posts about falling victim to the dreaded bootloop, and yet many people are very confused about their options. I wanted to write a guide in the hopes that even people with little/no advanced Android knowledge can potentially save their data or buy themselves a few extra months if their phone does bootloop. Please bear in mind that US customers can still get their phones repaired for free by LG in most circumstances, provided there is no physical or water damage. I am trying to flash my Redmi Note 5 CN (Chinese Version) to a custom ROM. I have unlocked the BootLoader and have put my phone into Fastboot Mode pressing "vol down + Power". USB debugging is enabled as well as developer settings (obviously). I use a Windows 10 Pro PC and still have the original Phone Cable. I am following Linus Tech Tips Flashing method as all other methods have failed me: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsHtfLh6azw (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsHtfLh6a. </p>
